        <p>Paneer is a soft, fresh Indian cheese made by curdling milk with an acidic agent like lemon juice or vinegar.
            It is non-melting, making it ideal for various dishes like Paneer Butter Masala and Palak Paneer. Rich in
            protein and calcium, itâ€™s a staple in vegetarian cuisine.

    <h1>steps to make paneer</h1>
    <h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the milk in a large pot over medium heat, stirring occasionally to prevent it from sticking.</li>
            <li>Dilute the lemon juice or vinegar with a little water (optional) to reduce the tanginess.</li>
            <li>Once the milk starts boiling, reduce the heat to low and slowly add the diluted lemon juice or vinegar, one tablespoon at a time.</li>
            <li>Stir gently as the milk curdles and separates into curds (solid) and whey (liquid).</li>
            <li>Once the whey is clear and greenish, turn off the heat immediately.</li>
            <li>Place a cheesecloth over a colander and pour the curdled milk through it to separate the curds from the whey</li>
            <li>Rinse the curds under cold water to remove the lemon/vinegar taste and cool them.</li>
            <li>Gather the ends of the cheesecloth and squeeze out excess water</li>
            <li>Place the wrapped curds on a flat surface, weigh them down with a heavy object, and let them set for 30 minutes to 1 hour</li>
            <li>Once firm, unwrap the paneer and cut it into desired shapes or sizes</li>
        </ol>
