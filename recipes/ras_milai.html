    <h1>steps to make ras milai</h1>
    <h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil 1 liter of milk and curdle it using diluted lemon juice or vinegar as described in the paneer
                recipe above.

            </li>
            <li>Rinse the curds with cold water to remove the acidic taste.</li>
            <li>Knead the paneer for 5-7 minutes into a smooth, soft dough.

            </li>
            <li>Divide the dough into small portions and shape into flat discs (about 1-inch diameter).</li>
            <li>In a large pot, boil 4 cups of water with 1 cup sugar until fully dissolved.</li>
            <li>Gently drop the paneer discs into the boiling sugar syrup, cover the pot, and cook for 10-12 minutes on
                medium heat.</li>
            <li>The discs will double in size. Remove from the syrup and set aside.</li>
            <li>In another pot, boil 1 liter of milk over medium heat until it reduces to half its volume, stirring
                occasionally.</li>
            <li>Add cardamom powder, saffron strands, and sugar (to taste) to the reduced milk.</li>
            <li>Simmer for 5-7 minutes, then remove from heat. Add rose water (optional).

            </li>
            <li>Gently squeeze excess syrup from the paneer discs and place them in the warm rabri.</li>
            <li>Allow the rasmalai to soak in the rabri for at least 1-2 hours</li>
            <li>Garnish with chopped nuts and chill in the refrigerator before serving.
